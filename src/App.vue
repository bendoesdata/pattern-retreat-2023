              Biomedical scientists rely on patient participation for their
              research. But the benefits of a breakthrough are not always felt
              for these patients in their lived experience.

              Pattern is a visualization lab situated within the Broad Institute
              with a mission to create visual tools and resources that drive
              science forward. We present three projects that features the use
              of visualization techniques to provide immediate value to patients
              in the form of more personal health information, a greater
              understanding of their disease, and the role of uncertainty and
              variability in genetic risk factors.

                      Genetic testing is currently recommended by the American
                      Academy of Pediatrics for all children with autism.
                      However, many clinicians and families report feeling under
                      informed about genetics and genetic testing. Insurance
                      also will not cover genetic testing in most cases.

                      Certain genetic variants have been identified as
                      especially impactful for an autistic child s development.
                      MINERVA is an interactive survey tool that uses a machine

                      child having a neurodevelopmental disorder associated

                      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an unpredictable and sometimes debilitating condition with few treatment options. We developed the GutSee in collaboration with MITâ€™s Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics to actively engage IBD sufferers with an intuitive and friendly user interface for logging and later viewing their symptoms and diet.

                      To improve genetic risk communication and support non-genetics clinicians and patients as they return and receive polygenic scores, we designed and developed a new polygenic score report and a supplemental web-based resource that utilizes scroll-based visualization techniques to provide a step-by-step explanation for understanding and interpreting polygenic scores.
